# Henry's Grocery Shopping Basket

A quick demo for a small grocery store which offers two discounts within a certain timeframe.

## Build & Run

The project uses the Gradle wrapper. The only requirement is a JDK (minimum 17).

Build the project with `./gradlew build`.

Start the application with `./gradlew run`.

## Usage

The command line interaction guides you through building the shopping basket. Currently, you can only build one basket per run and only add new entries to this one.
You add items via first entering the index number as displayed and then the number of units you wish to buy.
